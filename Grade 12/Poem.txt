The ancient forest stood silent under the heavy blanket of winter snow, preserving the secrets of the valley.
Sunlight filtered through the dense pine needles, casting long, sharp shadows on the frozen ground below.
A lone fox moved quietly across the stream, its bright red coat a stark contrast against the endless white.
Everything waited patiently for the gentle warmth of spring to finally break the icy stillness.
